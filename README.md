Hello!

1) That was the first touch of typescript for me and I have to admit that it was a nice journey;)
2) Project configured based on article: https://dev.to/alekseiberezkin/setting-up-react-typescript-app-without-create-react-app-oph
3) Basic navigation is the result of playing with new version of React Router v6
4) Some stuff was configured in tsconfig to redirect all server request to /index.html (to make localhost working)

Have a nice day!
